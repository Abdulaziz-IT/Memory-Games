## How to play?

This game is pretty **easy to play**, all you have to do is click on the cards that match together.
In order to win, you have to accomplish these 2 tasks:
- Find all cards that match together (8 successful moves).
- Finish before the specified time above!
  - You can change the time easily, if you're willing to make things more fun!
  
That's all you need to do!

Keep it mind that if the time is up and you didn't find all cards, you will _lose_ :disappointed:

If you feel like giving up, you can always click on the restart button which will reset the game for you, and shuffle the cards again!
## Time and stars

The game is initialized with **90 seconds**, that can be changed easily in code.
You will start the game with 3 stars, but once you reach **12 moves** you lose a star, and if you reach **20 moves** you will lose another star.

## Change the time

You can change the time of the game by editing code in **app.js** line 109:

```javascript
    const time = 90;
```
To the number of seconds you want.

## Can I play now?!

You surely can!
